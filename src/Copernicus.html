                        <b>Who was Copernicus?</b><br>
                        Nicolaus Copernicus was a polish astronomer, mathematician, and philosopher. He was born on the
                        19th of February, 1483CE, and passed on the 24th of May, 1543CE. He was most known for his model
                        of the solar system, which contradicted the teachings of past.

                        <b>What did he do?</b><br>
                        He was most known for his theory of a heliocentric solar system, instead of a geocentric one.
                        <br>
                        Geocentric views were the consensus in the past, before the works of Copernicus and Galileo.
                        These (geocentric) views were theorized by Ptolemy and the astronomers before him. He is
                        considered one of
                        the philosophers of the humanist/renaissance era, and he

                        <b>Heliocentrism vs Geocentrism</b><br>
                        Heliocentrism, from greek "Helios", meaning sun, and kentron, meaning center, from this
                        etymological breakdown, we can see that heliocentrism is the idea that the sun is the center.
                        Geocentrism, from geo, meaning Earth / land, and centrism, meaning Earth centered. These two
                        theories were conceived by man different philosophers, from many different cultures. For the
                        majority of history, the geocentric model was the consensus. From the Inuit hunters in the high
                        arctic of Canada, to the scientists in the Umayyad Islamic empire.

                        <b>What was his legacy?</b><br>
                        Our current understanding of the solar system is a modified copernican heliocentric model;
                        Copernicus also hypothesized that the rotation of the Earth was what led to a day / night cycle.
                        In the modern day, we observed the Earth, and his ideas of the Earth spinning were confirmed.
                        Copernicus also inspired Galileo, another famous astronomer, mathematician, and philosopher, but
                        unlike Copernicus, Galileo was very public about his work, and was condemned by the Catholic
                        Church at the time.
